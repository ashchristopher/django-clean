django-clean
====================

django-clean is a package that lets you specify files or directories that you
would like cleaned up. You can specify regular expressions to define which 
files you would like automatically removed.


Installation
------------
1. Add 'clean' to your installed apps in your settings.py file.  
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = [  
        'clean',
        ...
    ]  

    
2. Define a PROJECT_PATH in your settings.py file.  

    import os.path, sys  
    PROJECT_PATH = os.path.dirname(__file__)  

    
3. *OPTIONAL* Define the regular expression patterns you would like to match against in 
    your settings.py file. The default is a regex pattern to remove *.pyc files. (NOTE: The 
    regex matches against the full qualified path).
      
    CLEAN_PATTERNS = [  
        r'^.+\.pyc$',  
    ]  
    
    
Usage
-----
From your shell, type:  

    python manage.py clean  

This will prompt you to remove files that match the regular expression patterns.  

If you are confident in your regex, you can supply a --force option which will not prompt 
you before removing pattern matches.
